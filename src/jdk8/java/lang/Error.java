/**
 * An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable}
 * that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application
 * should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
 * The {@code ThreadDeath} error, though a "normal" condition,
 * is also a subclass of {@code Error} because most applications
 * should not try to catch it.
 * <p>
 * A method is not required to declare in its {@code throws}
 * clause any subclasses of {@code Error} that might be thrown
 * during the execution of the method but not caught, since these
 * errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.
 *
 * That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 * exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.

 *
 * Throwable       : 所有异常的祖先类
 * RuntimeException: 运行时异常，或称非检查异常；这类异常意味着程序出现了难以恢复的错误，允许不进行捕获
 * Exception       : 除运行时异常之外的异常，或称检查异常；这类异常意味着程序出现错误时可能是允许被恢复的，需要在编译期就捕获，否则无法编译
 * Error           : 非常严重的异常，该类异常往往意味着JVM内部出现了问题
